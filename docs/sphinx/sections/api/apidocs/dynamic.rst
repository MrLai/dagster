Dynamic Mapping & Collect
=========================

These APIs provide the means for a simple kind of *dynamic orchestration* â€” where the work to be orchestrated is determined not at pipeline definition time but at runtime, dependent on data that's observed as part of pipeline execution.

.. autoclass:: DynamicOutput


Mapping Details
---------------

To establish dependencies on a dynamic output in a composition function like ones decorated by :py:class:`job` or :py:class:`graph`, the ``map`` function is used on the object representing the dynamic output. `map` takes a ``Callable`` which receives a single argument. This callable is evaluated once, and the :py:class:`op` or :py:class:`graph` that are passed the input argument will establish dependencies. The return value from the callable is captured and wrapped in an object that allows for subsequent ``map`` or ``collect`` calls.

**Basic**

In this example, the ``op`` ``echo`` is called on the static output from ``emit``, as well as for each dynamic output from ``dynamic_values``. Then all of the ``echo`` results that were called on the dynamic outputs of ``dynamic_values`` are collected, and ``process`` will receive them as a ``list``.

.. code-block:: python

    @job
    def basic():
        # regular dependency
        echo(emit())

        # dynamic output dependency
        results = dynamic_values().map(echo)

        # gathering results
        process(results.collect())



**Chaining**

The following two examples are equivalent ways to establish a sequence of :py:class:`op` that occur for each dynamic output.


.. code-block:: python

    @job
    def chained():
        results = dynamic_values().map(step_1).map(step_2).map(step_3)
        process(results.collect())


.. code-block:: python

    @job
    def chained():

        def _for_each(val):
            a = step_1(val)
            b = step_2(a)
            return step_3(b)

        results = dynamic_values().map(_for_each)

        process(results.collect())

**Additional Arguments**

A lambda or scoped function can be used to pass non-dynamic outputs along side dynamic ones in ``map`` downstream.

.. code-block:: python

    @job
    def other_arg():
        non_dynamic = plain_op()
        dynamic_values().map(lambda val: process(val, non_dynamic))

**Multiple Outputs**

Multiple outputs are returned via a ``namedtuple``, where each entry can be used via ``map`` or ``collect``.

.. code-block:: python

    @job
    def multiple():
        # can unpack on assignment (order based)
        a_values, b_values = multiple_dynamic_values()

        do_stuff(a_values.collect())

        # or access by name
        outs = b_values.map(static_multi_out)
        process(outs.output_c.collect())
