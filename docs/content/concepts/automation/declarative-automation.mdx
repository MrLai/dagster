# Declarative Automation

<Note>
  This feature is currently <strong>experimental</strong>.
</Note>

Dagster can automatically materialize assets when criteria are met, enabling a declarative approach to asset materialization. Instead of defining explicit workflows to materialize assets, you describe the conditions under which they should be materialized and let the system kick off runs in response.

For example, you have an asset that's scheduled to execute every day at midnight. Instead of executing whether there's new data or not, you can use Declarative Automation to materialize the asset only after its parent has been updated.

Declarative Automation includes pre-built conditions to handle common use cases, such as executing on a periodic schedule or whenever an upstream dependency updates, but conditions can also be customized.

---

## Benefits

Using Declarative Automation helps you:

- Ensure you're working with the most up-to-date data
- Optimize resource usage by only materializing assets when needed
- Simplify how your team understands their assets by consolidating all asset logic to a single location
- Avoid thinking about specific workflow boundaries, such as a [schedule accounting for timezones or Daylight Savings Time](/concepts/automation/schedules/customizing-executing-timezones)

---

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, you should be familiar with:

- [Asset definitions](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets)
- [Sensor definitions](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors)
- [Code locations](/concepts/code-locations)

## How it works

Declarative Automation is an automation method that kicks off runs when criteria are met. This method contains two main components:

- **An automation condition (<PyObject object="AutomationCondition" />**), which represents when an individual asset should be executed.
- **A sensor (<PyObject object="AutomationConditionSensorDefinition" />**), which evaluates each <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> and launches runs in response to their status.

### Automation conditions

Automation conditions describe the conditions under which an asset should be executed. Dagster provides two pre-built conditions:

<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "25%",
        }}
      >
        Name
      </th>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "40%",
        }}
      >
        Description
      </th>
      <th>Useful for</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>AutomationCondition.eager()</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        This condition will materialize an asset:
        <ul>
          <li>If the asset has never been materialized before, or</li>
          <li>
            When the asset's parents update, as long as none of the parents are
            currently missing or have an update in progress
          </li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul
          style={{
            marginTop: "0px",
          }}
        >
          <li
            style={{
              marginTop: "0px",
            }}
          >
            Automatically propagating changes through the asset graph
          </li>
          <li>Ensuring assets remain up-to-date</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>AutomationCondition.on_cron(cron_schedule)</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        This condition will materialize an asset once per cron schedule tick,
        after all of its parents have been updated since the tick
      </td>
      <td>
        Regularly updating an asset without worrying about the specifics of how
        its parents update
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Automation conditions can be set on the <PyObject object="asset" decorator /> decorator or on an <PyObject object="AssetSpec" />:

```python
from dagster import AssetSpec, AutomationCondition, asset

@asset(automation_condition=AutomationCondition.eager())
def my_eager_asset(): ...

AssetSpec("my_cron_asset", automation_condition=AutomationCondition.on_cron("@daily"))
```

The core <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> framework is extremely flexible, allowing you to build custom conditions from the ground up. Refer to the [Customizing automation conditions guide](/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/customizing-automation-conditions) for more information.

### Sensors

When automation conditions for an asset are met, a sensor will kick off a run to materialize the asset. This sensor, named `default_automation_condition_sensor`, will be available for each code location and monitor all assets within that location. To use multiple sensors or change the properties of the default sensor, refer to the <PyObject object="AutomationConditionSensorDefinition" /> documentation.

For an automation condition sensor to run, it must be turned on and an active [`dagster-daemon` process](/deployment/dagster-daemon) must be running. If you used [`dagster dev` to start the Dagster UI/webserver](/guides/running-dagster-locally), the daemon process will be automatically launched alongside the webserver.

After these criteria are met, the sensor's evaluation history will be visible in the UI:

<!-- ![Default automation sensor evaluations in the Dagster UI](/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/default-automation-sensor.png) -->

<Image

src="/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/default-automation-sensor.png"
width={1898}
height={863}
/>

You'll also be able to view a detailed history of each asset's evaluations on the asset's [**Asset Details** page](/concepts/webserver/ui#asset-details). This allows you to see why an asset was or wasn't materialized at different points in time:

## Getting started

To use Declarative Automation, you'll need to enable the automation condition sensor in the Dagster UI:

1. Navigate to **Overview > Sensors**
2. Locate the desired code location.
3. In the code location, toggle the `default_automation_condition_sensor` sensor to on.

From here, you can:

- Define custom automation conditions
- View a history of each evaluation for the sensor
- Navigate to individual assets to see a history of their evaluations
