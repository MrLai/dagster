# Creating custom Declarative Automation conditions

<Note>
  Declarative Automation is currently <strong>experimental</strong>.
</Note>

[Declarative Automation](/concepts/automation/declarative-automation) includes pre-built conditions to handle common use cases, such as executing on a periodic schedule or whenever an upstream dependency updates, but you can also customize conditions.

By the end of this guide, you'll understand how <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" pluralize /> work and how to create your own custom conditions.

---

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, you should be familiar with:

- [Asset definitions](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets)
- [Declarative Automation](/concepts/automation/declarative-automation)

---

## How it works

Each <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> consists of a set of **operands** and various **operators**. To create conditions that suit your specific needs, you can combine the operators and operands listed below. For example:

```python
from dagster import AutomationCondition

in_progress_or_failed_parents = AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(
    AutomationCondition.in_progress() | AutomationCondition.failed()
)
```

This condition translates to **Any upstream dependencies (parents) part of an in-progress run or failed during the latest run**.

### Operands

Operands are base conditions which can be true or false about a given asset partition.

| Operand                                     | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AutomationCondition.missing`               | Returns true if the asset partition has never been materialized or observed                                                                       |
| `AutomationCondition.in_progress`           | Returns true if the asset partition is part of an in-progress run                                                                                 |
| `AutomationCondition.failed`                | Returns true if the asset partition failed to be materialized in its latest run                                                                   |
| `AutomationCondition.newly_updated`         | Returns true if the asset partition was materialized since the previous evaluation                                                                |
| `AutomationCondition.newly_requested`       | Returns true if the asset partition was requested on the previous evaluation                                                                      |
| `AutomationCondition.code_version_changed`  | Returns true if the asset has a new code version since the previous evaluation                                                                    |
| `AutomationCondition.cron_tick_passed`      | Returns true if a new tick of the provided cron schedule occurred since the previous evaluation                                                   |
| `AutomationCondition.in_latest_time_window` | Returns true if the asset partition falls within the latest time window of the assetâ€™s <PyObject object="PartitionsDefinition" />, if applicable. |
| `AutomationCondition.will_be_requested`     | Returns true if the asset partition will be requested in this tick                                                                                |

### Operators

        evaluates to true
      </td>

</table>

## Targeting dependencies

Upstream assets commonly influence downstream materialization decisions. To create automation conditions that target dependencies, use the `AutomationCondition.any_deps_match()` operator. This operator takes an arbitrary <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" />, applies it to each upstream asset, and then maps the results to the corresponding downstream partitions.

This operator and `AutomationCondition.all_deps_match()` can be further customized to only target specific sets of upstream assets by using `.allow()` and `.ignore()`.

For example, to target updates from a specific asset group, you can use `any_deps_match` with the `newly_updated` operand and tell it to target only the `metrics` asset group:

```python
from dagster import AssetSelection, AutomationCondition

AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(
    AutomationCondition.newly_updated()
).allow(AssetSelection.groups("metrics"))
```

Or to ignore missing partitions from an upstream asset, you can use `any_deps_match` with the `missing` operand and tell it to ignore a specific asset:

```python
AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(
    AutomationCondition.missing()
).ignore(AssetSelection.keys("taxi_trips"))
```

## Describing conditions with labels

When there are a large number of sub-conditions that make up an <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" />, it can be difficult to understand and troubleshoot the condition. To make conditions easier to understand, you can attach labels to sub-conditions, which will then display in the Dagster UI.

Arbitrary string labels can be attached to any node in the <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> tree by using the `with_label()` method, allowing you to describe the purpose of a specific sub-condition. For example:

```python
from dagster import AutomationCondition

in_progress_or_failed_parents = AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(
    AutomationCondition.in_progress() | AutomationCondition.failed()
).with_label("Any parents in progress or failed")
```

Then, when viewing evaluation results in the UI, the label will display next to the condition:

<!-- ![Any parents in progress or failed condition label in the Dagster UI](/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/condition-label.png) -->

<Image
alt="Any parents in progress or failed condition label in the Dagster UI"
src="/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/condition-label.png"
width={1576}
height={418}
/>

Hovering over or expanding the label will display its sub-conditions:

<!-- ![Expanded Any parents in progress or failed condition label with a list of sub-conditions in the Dagster UI](/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/condition-label-expanded.png) -->

<Image
alt="Expanded Any parents in progress or failed condition label with a list of sub-conditions in the Dagster UI"
src="/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/condition-label-expanded.png"
width={1576}
height={593}
/>

---

## Using statuses and events in conditions

In some cases, you may want to use statuses and events in your automation conditions:

- **Statuses** are persistent states that are and will be true for some period of time. For example, the `AutomationCondition.missing()` condition will be true only if an asset partition has never been materialized or observed.
- **Events** are transient and reflect something that may only be true for an instant. For example, the `AutomationCondition.newly_updated()` condition will be true only if an asset partition was materialized since the previous evaluation.

Using the `<A>.since(<B>)` operator, you can create conditions that detect if one event has happened more recently than another. Think of this as converting two events to a status - in this case, `A has occurred more recently than B` - as this will stay true for some period of time. This operator becomes true whenever `<A>` is true, and will remain true until `<B>` is also true.

Conversely, it can also be useful to convert statuses to events. For example, the default `eager()` condition ensures that Dagster only tries to materialize a missing asset partition once using the following sub-condition:

```python
from dagster import AutomationCondition

AutomationCondition.missing().newly_true().since(
    AutomationCondition.newly_requested() | AutomationCondition.newly_updated()
)
```

By using the `<A>.newly_true()` operator, you can turn the status of _"being missing"_ into a single event, specifically the point in time where an asset partition entered the _missing_ state. From there, you can ensure that an asset is materialized only once in response to detecting a missing partition.

## Using conditions to chain runs

Dagster can group the execution of multiple assets into a single, logical run. For example, imagine you have a series of dependent assets, each with an `AutomationCondition.eager()` condition. When you update the first asset in the chain, the desired behavior is typically to have all downstream assets grouped into a single run, rather than executing each asset in order in individual run.

To create this scenario, you can use `AutomationCondition.will_be_requested()`. Because each <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> is evaluated in order, you can query if an upstream asset will be requested on the current tick. For example:

```python
from dagster import AutomationCondition

any_parent_missing = AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(
    AutomationCondition.missing() & ~AutomationCondition.will_be_requested()
)
```
