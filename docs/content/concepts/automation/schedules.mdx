# Schedules

Schedules are Dagster's way of supporting traditional methods of [automation](/concepts/automation), which allow you to specify when a [job](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs) should run. Using schedules, you can define a fixed time interval to run a pipeline, such as daily, hourly, or Monday at 9:00 AM.

Each interval of a schedule is called a **tick**, which is an indication that a job should execute. Ticks kick off **runs**, which is a single instance of a job being executed.

When viewing a schedule in [Dagster's UI](/concepts/webserver/ui), you can see the schedule's definition, executing timezone, targeted jobs and partitions, as well as its tick and run history.

## Benefits

Using schedules helps you:

- Predictably process and deliver data to stakeholders and business-critical applications
- Consistently run data pipelines without the need for manual intervention
- Optimize resource usage by scheduling pipelines to run during off-peak hours

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, you should be familiar with:

- [Cron syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)
- [Assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) and [asset jobs](/concepts/assets/asset-jobs)
- [Ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) and [op jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/op-jobs) _(optional)_

## How it works

Schedules run jobs at fixed time intervals and have two main components:

- **A job**, which targets a selection of assets or ops
- [**A cron expression**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), which defines when the schedule runs. Simple and complex schedules are supported, allowing you to have fine-grained control over when runs are executed. With cron syntax, you can:

  - **Create custom schedules** like `Every hour from 9:00AM - 5:00PM` with cron expressions (`0 9-17 * * *`)
  - **Quickly create basic schedules** like `Every day at midnight` with predefined cron definitions (`@daily`, `@midnight`)

  To make creating cron expressions easier, you can use an online tool like [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/). This tool allows you to create and describe cron expressions in a human-readable format and test the execution dates produced by the expression. **Note**: While this tool is useful for general cron expression testing, always remember to [test your schedules](/concepts/automation/schedules/testing) in Dagster to ensure the results are as expected.

For a schedule to run, it must be turned on and an active [`dagster-daemon` process](/deployment/dagster-daemon) must be running. If you used [`dagster dev` to start the Dagster UI/webserver](/guides/running-dagster-locally), the daemon process will be automatically launched alongside the webserver.

After these criteria are met, the schedule will run at the interval specified in the cron expression. **Schedules will execute in UTC by default**, but [you can specify a custom timezone](/concepts/automation/schedules/customizing-executing-timezones).

## Getting started

Check out these guides to get started with schedules:

<div className="w-full inline-flex flex-col space-y-2 md:space-y-0 md:flex-row md:space-x-4">
  <Button link="/concepts/automation/schedules/automating-assets-schedules-jobs">
    Assets & schedules
  </Button>
  <Button link="/concepts/automation/schedules/automating-ops-schedules-jobs">
    Ops & schedules
  </Button>
  <Button link="/concepts/automation/schedules/examples" style="secondary">
    Examples
  </Button>
</div>

From here, you can:

- Construct schedules to run [partitioned jobs](/concepts/automation/schedules/partitioned-schedules)
- Execute jobs in [specific timezones](/concepts/automation/schedules/customizing-executing-timezones)
- Learn to [test your schedules](/concepts/automation/schedules/testing)
- Identify and resolve common issues with our [troubleshooting guide](/concepts/automation/schedules/troubleshooting)

### Limitations and notes

- Dagster supports all [predefined cron definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Nonstandard_predefined_scheduling_definitions) with the exeception of `@reboot`
- Schedules will execute in UTC [unless a timezone is specified](/concepts/automation/schedules/customizing-executing-timezones)
- When defining a schedule's execution time, keep [Daylight Savings Time (DST) in mind](/concepts/automation/schedules/customizing-executing-timezones#execution-times-and-daylight-savings-time)
